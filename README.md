# Remove warings - a Foundry VTT module

Ever got annoied by "MESSAGE Foundry Virtual Tabletop requires a minimum screen resolution of 1024px by 700px or greater. Your display currently has an effective resolution of 2560px by 685px, as a result many features of the software may not work properly."?

This module does just that, you can configure more warnings or messages you want to hide forever.

Every client can configure the module indipendently. 

The orginal code is from https://github.com/Eunomiac here: https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/foundryvtt-devMode/pull/59#issuecomment-1905479387, I just modified it a little and made it configurable.
