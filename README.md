# Remove warings - a Foundry VTT module

### Module Overview

Have you ever been annoyed by the message:

![immagine](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63e8149f-1c14-4e83-ab8f-3eeb0b2f07ef)


> *"Foundry Virtual Tabletop requires a minimum screen resolution of 1024px by 700px or greater. Your display currently has an effective resolution of 2560px by 685px; as a result, many features of the software may not work properly."*

This module addresses that issue by allowing you to configure and permanently hide such warnings or messages.

### Features

- **Customizable**: You can configure which warnings or messages to hide.
- **Independent Configuration**: Each client can independently configure the module to their preferences.

### Credits

The original code is from [Eunomiac on GitHub](https://github.com/Eunomiac) at this link: [League-of-Foundry-Developers/foundryvtt-devMode#59 (comment)](https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/foundryvtt-devMode/issues/59#issuecomment-761050561). Iâ€™ve made some modifications to make it configurable.
